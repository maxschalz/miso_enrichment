# misoenrichment

This directory contains the Python code used to calculate the staging and
enrichment for the Cyclus `MIsoEnrich` archetype. It may only serve as a
temporary solution and may be deleted later in favour of a solution that relies
purely on C++ code and libraries.

This approach is used to temporarily alleviate or definitively solve
[issue #19](https://github.com/Nuclear-Verification-and-Disarmament/miso_enrichment/issues/19).
